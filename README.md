## VN (Vector Neuron) Transformer

A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04176">Transformer made of Rotation-equivariant Attention</a> using <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12229">Vector Neurons</a>

## Install

```bash
$ pip install VN-transformer
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from VN_transformer import VNTransformer

model = VNTransformer(
    dim = 64,
    depth = 2,
    dim_head = 64,
    heads = 8,
    dim_feat = 64,       # will default to early fusion, since this was the best performing
    bias_epsilon = 1e-6  # in this paper, they propose breaking equivariance with a tiny bit of bias noise in the VN linear. they claim this leads to improved stability. setting this to 0 would turn off the epsilon approximate equivariance
)

feats = torch.randn(1, 32, 64)
coors = torch.randn(1, 32, 3)    # (batch, sequence, spatial coordinates)

out = model(coors, feats = feats) # (1, 32, 64 + 3 = 67)
```

## Tests

Confidence in equivariance

```bash
$ python setup.py test
```

## Todo

- [x] complete the perceiver like feature aggregation
- [x] offer early fusion within `VNTransformer` with setting of `dim_feat`
- [ ] see if it is straightforward to make translation in/equivariant
    - [ ] test on protein backbone denoising if above could be done
